  tons of analogies in cryptography

  -

One of my favorite things about the field of cryptography is its love for a
great analogy. Modern cryptography is largely a mathematical subfield of
computer science and game theory, but it's roots lie in the need to
secretly communicate over long distances with untrusted messengers.

For decades, cryptographers have filled journals with papers
narrating the adventures of Alice and Bob, the primary protagonists in
cryptography's most famous thought experiments.

The best thing about these analogies is that they're often very close to the
real thing! For instance, the RSA algorithm is often explained with an
analogy to paint mixing

## The Analogy

Alice is walking thorgh a bookstore, and walks up to the counter with a book of "Where's Waldo?" puzzles.
"Great choice," says the cashier, Bob. "I drew those puzzles myself!
