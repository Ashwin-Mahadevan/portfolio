Cryptographers don't get asked about their work that often. This comes with the
territory: most technical disciplines simply aren't that interesting to the
public.

## The Analogy

Imagine that you're reading a "Where's Waldo?" book with your friend. They're stuck on a page
that they think is difficult, but you've already found Waldo. So, naturally, you start to mock them.

But they protest! "You don't know where Waldo is," they say, "you just don't want to look silly."
