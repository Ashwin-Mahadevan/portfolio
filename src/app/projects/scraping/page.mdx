# Scraping

One of my hobbies is collecting data. I gather it on a Raspberry-Pi that
I maintain running at home. Since there's tons of data (on the order of
terabytes), it's all stored locally on hard-disks. If you want access,
reach out to me and I'll see what I can do!

## Apple App Store Top Charts

I scrape Apple's App Store for the top charts in 175 countries. I
collect data in the following categories, for each country separately,
every five minutes:

## Prediction Market Orderbooks

Prediction markets are derivatives exchanges where participants trade
contracts tied to real-world events. The prices of these contracts
correspond the probability of an event occurring. While platforms like
Kalshi and Polymarket share historical aggregated execution data, they
don't provide historical orderbook data. I address this gap by
collecting real-time orderbook data for all active markets on both
platforms.
